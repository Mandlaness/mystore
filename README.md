Steps to Install Magento 2 with Composer

1. Install Composer

You can skip this step if you have Composer already installed. Windows users have an installer available.

  ``curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

1.1 Make Composer Globally Available

If you wish, you can additionally install Composer globally so you donâ€™t have to type ``php/path/to/composer.phar every time. The Windows installer will automatically set up the PATH system variable.

``mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
